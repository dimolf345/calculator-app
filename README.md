## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Typescript
- CSS Grid
- Parcel bundler

### What I learned

The difficult part of this project was to design the OOP classes in order to make all the calculator funcionality works. It was a nice exercise for encapsulation, single responsability concepts that are part of the SOLID principles of the OOP paradigm.

### Continued development

I will surely write an other project with same level of difficulty to improve my skills with TS and OOP.
